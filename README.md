ASL Hand Sign Recognition is a computer vision project that uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and a machine learning model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) letters (Aâ€“Y). It enables real-time detection, dataset creation, and prediction from webcam input, helping bridge the gap in gesture-based communication.
